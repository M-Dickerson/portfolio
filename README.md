# Portfolio

## Description

The motivation and purpose behind this project was to re-create our first portfolio using react. It solves the problem of not having a professional portfolio that can be used to showcase our best works. It also solves the issue of not having a portfolio with a contact form. I learned a lot about using react, as well as styling with reacts own bootstrap.
